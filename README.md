Hi, I am Leivy.

I am a highly passionate engineer that enjoys working in a collaborative team to develop meaningful applications using agile workflow and iterative development. My experience involves building scalable, customer focused web applications with Angular, Python, Java, Node/Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL to name a few.

Practicing integrity and honesty, among other principles are very important to me.
