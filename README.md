Hi, I am Leivy.

I am a highly passionate engineer that enjoys working in collaborative teams to develop meaningful applications using agile workflow and iterative development. My experience involves building scalable, customer focused web applications with Angular, Node/Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker to name a few.

Practicing integrity and honesty, among other principles are very important to me.
